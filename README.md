# Tata_Steel

And it's a wrap.
Data Analyst Summer Internship at Tata Steel and the journey was awesome with enriching experience along with e-learning modules including Machine Learning and Industry 4.0, the TATA Steel brand which reflects the value-system alignment and integrity which it upholds along with the plethora of opportunities all along the way.
The two-month-long journey I had with TATA Steel taught me about the detailed cognizance of dealing with surplus raw data and the nuances to be followed while conducting Analysis to map the Rolling Mill parameter data to establish insights for enhanced process stability.
